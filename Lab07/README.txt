Lab 06
Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

This lab was an introduction to c programming, and it looked at using pointers in c. We started by having it print out all of the arguments given when it was called. Then we made a string compair method using pointers. Next a string concatenation method was created. Then a string copy using pointer. Then we modified the first part to check to see if our name was input in the arguments, and if it was use the methods we just wrote to print out hello befor our name. An array was then printed out using the pointer method.

The output can be found in the OUTPUT.txt file. To compile run gcc pointers.c
It can be run by running the out file: ./a.out h r t Nick nick HG 12
