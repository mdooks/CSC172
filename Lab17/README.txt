Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

For this lab I used the built in java hashmap and mapped zip codes (ints), to Cities (strings). I read in a large list of values from a csv file, and put them into the hashmap. I then asked the user to input zip codes and we returned the City and state. Then I created a hashmap to link the Cities to the number of zipcodes that they had. I then looped through asking the user for City names, and returned the number of zip codes that it had.

Compile: javac *.java
Run: java ZipCode
