Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

For this lab different Combinatorics algorithms were implemented. The first was
counting assignments, which is simply raising the number of options to the number
of items, which was implemented in a loop. The second method implemented a counting
permutations, which is modified factorial. The third method implemented an ordered
selection, which is also a combination of factorials. The final method was an
unordered selection which is a sum of a combination of factorials. Test cases of
each of these were also implemented in the main function.

 The output can be found in the OUTPUT.txt file. To compile run javac *.java
 then run using java test.
