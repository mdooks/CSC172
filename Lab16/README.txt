Lab 16
Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

For this lab we implemented the Hash function that was shown in the book, and used it to count the number of unique words in the LoremIpsum.txt. We set it up so that it would double the size of the array when the load factor became larger then 0.5. It then printed out the words and total number in the file.

Compile: To compile please run: javac *.java
Run: java Hash
