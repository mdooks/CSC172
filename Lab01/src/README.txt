Lab 01

For this lab the topic of generics was explored. In the file lab01.java It started by implementing a method to print arrays of different types using the fact that they were all subclasses of Object. It then had us redo that function using overloading, and finally redo that using generics. It then had us implement a getMax method using the fact that they were all subclasses of Comparable. This resulted in a compiler warning. The function was then redone using generics which removed the compiler warning. Then in file lab01_part6.java sudo code from the textbook was modified to find the max character in a character array using the Function Object technique.

The output file contains the output of the files written for Lab01.
