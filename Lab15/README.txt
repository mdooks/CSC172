Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

This lab looks at lambda in scheme. It started by having us observe how some code ran, defining variables, and functions, and how to properly set them up. It then had us look at code implementing a triangle sum, a sum of squares, and a sum of cubes. Then it walks us through how one could abstract the sums out to general structure that applied a different function to each i, but leaving the sum on its own. It then had us look at how these could be implemented using a lambda function so that the operations preformed on each element did not require a separate function definition. Then it had us implement our own function to model a geometric function. Finally it also showed us how lambda could be used to set up local variables.

There is no compiling necessary for this lab. Run the code in Dr Racket with the language set to Pretty Big.
