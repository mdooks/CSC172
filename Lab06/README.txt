Lab 06
Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

For this lab we modified our code from lab 2, the single linked list, and created a stack. A pop method was made that returned the first item and removed it. A push method was made that put an item in at the front, and a peek method was made that showed what item was at the top of the stack. A simple test was then run which inserted a couple letters into a stack, then peeked and poped some of them. Then we implemented a Queue using the code from lab 3Here an enqueue method was made to put an item at the end of the line, and then a dequeue method was made to get the first item in line. A peek method was also made that just showed the value at the start of the queue.

 The output can be found in the OUTPUT.txt file. To compile run javac *.java
 then run the StackTest using java StackTest
 The Queue test can be run using java QueueTest
