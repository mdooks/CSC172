Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

For this lab different Combinatorics algorithms were implemented. The first looked
at ordering with identical items. This was done by setting up a combination of
factorials. The second method looked at distributing indistinguishable objects into
bins. For this method I utilized the unordered selection method from lab 4 to handle most of the math. The final method looked at distributing distinguishable items. This was done by combining factorials.

 The output can be found in the OUTPUT.txt file. To compile run javac *.java
 then run using java test.
