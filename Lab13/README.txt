Lab TA: Kate Zeng Zhiming
Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

This lab looked at scheme, in Dr.Racket. We started by demonstrating code, focusing on making lists, and using them. I started by going through some of the examples that showed how to make a list, print a list, get the first element, and get everything but the first element. Then I looked at examples used to make a pair, and how to get the first or the second element from that. Then using the provide functions for making and printing a rational number, I wrote functions to add, subtract, multiply and divide the rational numbers, as one to test their equality. I then tested these with a variety of numbers.

There is no need to compile. run the code in Dr. Racket, with the language set to R5RS.
