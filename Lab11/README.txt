Lab Session: Wednesday 6:15 - 7:30

This lab looked at scheme, in Dr.Racket. We started by demonstrating code, such as basic math and printing, as well as conditional statements and function definitions. Finally we wrote our own method to find the greatest common factor, using an algorithm found on wikipedia, If the two numbers are equal return one of them, otherwise find the greatest common factor of the lager one - the smaller one, and the smaller one.

No compiling necessary. Run code in Dr. Racket.
